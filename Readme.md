# Key Features
* Adding expense and income separetely. You can even delete the expense or income from the list
* Saving data in localStorage to make it persistent. If the user is in the same month, no matter if he/she reloads the page, the app will keep the budget state. In order to do this, I'm saving now the month and year as part of the app data.
